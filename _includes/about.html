                <h2>About the NDSU ACM</h2>
                <p>Our student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery was established at North Dakota State University in 1974. Since then the organization has been involved with providing services, organizing programming competitions, and offering education and social opportunites for its members. While most of the members are Computer Science students, the ACM also welcomes people in other fields who are interested in technology. Thus our chapter also has students in Mathematics, Engineering, Psychology, and other Sciences.</p>
