# What We Went Over:

- Bank Account
  - $737.39
- Byte-le Results
  - $538 remains in the Byte-le account after this year's competition
  - The game went really well with 16 teams!
  - Rewards for the top three teams (four in total with a tie in third place) have already been given out as Amazon gift cards
- Byte-le Team
  - Idea proposed of separating the board from Byte-le development directly and having the Vice Chair take charge of creating the team for developing Byte-le
  - The Byte-le team must be approved by the Board prior to beginning development on Byte-le
  - This change is being proposed so that development for Byte-le can be started prior to elections for the ACM Board, and so board members are not "forced" to work on development on the game
  - After the inital team is created, the Byte-le team decides who joins the team afterward
  - As for roles in Byte-le development, it is recommended to have the following roles:
    - Developers (Five Minimum)
      - Two developers should have little to no experience
      - Two developers should have previous experience
      - One developer should be the Scrum Master
        - This role is elected by the Board and should have been on a previous Byte-le development team with experience
    - Artists (Two Recommended)
      - Artists can be developers
    - Testers
      - QA Testers (1-2 Recommended)
        - 1-2 try to play the game
        - Should include at least a developer and one not currently developing Byte-le
      - Playtesters (Four maximum)
        - Should play the game like the competition as the game reaches a state of completion
        - Cannot have seen Byte-le and cannot compete in Byte-le after playtesting
        - Can include an alumni (One Maximum)
- ACM Merch
  - Sent out a google form for ACM merch interest
  - Currently have three responses
  - Added stickers to the form
- February Game Night
  - This month's game night will be held on February 23rd, starting at 6:30pm in the ACM room
  - Prior, there will be a member meeting for the ACM merch google form
- SIGs Starting
  - Most of the SIGs have found times and have started
  - The following SIGs have yet to start this semester
    - SIG-Collab
    - SIG-Functional
    - SIG-Modding
- SIG-Collab: Byte-le Revamp 2.0
  - The next Byte-le game should be developed on the next version of the Byte-le engine
  - With this, the revamp collab should be developed soon so the developers for Byte-le can work with it as soon as possible

# Board TO DO:

- Look into one professor talk spotlight per year
