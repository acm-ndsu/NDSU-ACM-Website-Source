# What We Went Over:
- Bank Account
    - $ 1,268.65
- ACM Fiscal Report
    - A Fiscal Report for the ACM has to be sent to the National ACM on August 31st. Carson will be in charge of this
- ACM Logo Problems
    - We have been getting emails about not using the national ACM logo and instead using the chapter logo. We will look further into this
- SIG Discussion
    - We will begin reaching out to people to plan for SIG's next semester. SIG sign up forms will be available in the ACM room
    - SIG-Com. Sci. Ideas
        - Currently, weekly meetings are not engaging and not as successful
        - SIG-Com. Sci would replace weekly meetings, and would be a SIG for members to teach a different topic related to Com. Sci. weekly based on what interests them, with members rotating through teaching and learning. This SIG could also make times for these meetings more flexible, and would have a leader (Vice-Chair) to organize who gets to teach on which weeks
        - This allows the current weekly meeting system to be better organized and hopefully help attendance for these meetings
        - Name for SIG is still up for debate
- ACM Awards Ideas
    - Idea for awards for members contributing to club and being more involved, with an award ceremony happening every semester
- Hardware and Services List
    - On April, 21st, at 3pm, Ian will be meeting with Denton and Guy Hokanson along with Gabe, Roman, and Reed to discuss creating a lists of hardware and services that the ACM uses
- FBS Cooperation
    - FBS, a local software company in Fargo, is looking to get involved with the NDSU ACM
    - We discussed ideas for looking into sponsorships with FBS and Byte-le, as well as internship and co-op opportunities and corp-talks, as well as capstone projects with the department and career fair booths
    - We will look further into this company and contact them in the near future
- Air Conditioning Fix
    - Air Conditioning was fixed in the ACM room!
- Byte-le Sponsorship/Fundraising Discussion
    - Carson will discuss with company Be the Match for a potential sponsorship for Byte-le
