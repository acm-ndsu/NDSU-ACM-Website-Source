# What We Went Over:

- Bank Account
  - $802.92
- Devii Corp-talk Reschedule
  - Due to some events, Devii was not able to speak with us this week.
  - Will be rescheduling this corp-talk for the fall semester if possible.
- Byte-le Server Reregister
  - Discussed reregistering the ACM Right computer to use for hosting Byte-le. If this occurs, the computer would be reserved for only board members.
  - We will, for now, keep using the linux lab for hosting Byte-le instead as of hosting it in the ACM room, as it is away from competitors and offers more space for development during the competition.
- GitHub Workshop: Week 3 Testing
  - Tested the GitHub examples for the Workshop tomorrow.
