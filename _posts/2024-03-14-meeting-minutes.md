  - Recruited some ACM members and Katy from the department to help make videos, will work on them sometime soon. 
- Connect with FUll Stack Fargo:
  - Holding off on it for now. 
- Professor Spotlight tomorrow (3-13-24)
  - Due to ordering merch, snack run soon, and the picnic coming up, we don't want to spend money on catering. 
  - Especially since we don't expect many people to show up. 
- A member has mentioned that the ACM Zelle didn't work for them. 
  - The treasurer figured out the phone number got removed due to the treasurer changing the Zelle phone number. 
  - We will have to make a new phone number for it. 
- Rules of forming the Byte-le team;
  - Need to write it down and put it in the drive to reference in the future. 
  - Assigned the Vice Chair to do that. 
  - This document will be put in the Byte-le folder in the ACM drive. 
    - On top of that we need to make official documents that will have guidelines on how to run specific groups.
    - This will specifically be for:
      - Forming the Byte-le team.
      - GitHub Workshop.
      - Adding Zelle and how to transfer it. 
      - SIG Workshop so that people know what that is. 
- SDSU Competition:
  - Only one person is interested. 
    - Not enough people interested, so we will not be going. 
- Recap from CSO meeting from 3-13-24
  - Ratify the constiution every three years.
  - New discrimination clause to add. 
  - Fill out a fundraiser form found on MyNDSU when receiving sponsorships. 
  - Fill out travling forms two weeks before the time of travel. 
    - With that, every student traveling needs to log into their MyNDSU page at least once before travel. 
    - We will probably tell our members to log into MyNDSU once a semester. 
  - NDSU works with Enterprise, and Enterprise waives the 25 y/o renting rule. 
  - So we can rent cars if we are 21 and up, but there will be a fee for it.
  - Elections should always be held at the end of March or early April. 
  - Make an agenda after elections for the new board members to go over. 
    - This includes:
      - Who to contact and what for. 
      - Constitution. 
      - New board members need to be paid members of the ACM. 
      - Going to CSO for budget. 
      - Listing annual procedures (already in drive). 
      - Picnic is the first thing every new board has to do. 
      - Transfer of accounts. 
      - Any important ec meeting minutes. 
      - Banking information.
  - Organization registration is always due October 1st unless specified otherwise. 
  - 
- We are at a standing of five. 
- Need to upload financial forms to drive. 
- Logistics for elections:
  - The former chair, the current treasurer, vice chair and member at large will be the election committee for this year. 
  - Make a google form with the names, and edit the form for each position we are voting for. 
- We have six candidates, at least one person is running for each position. 
- We will make an announcement about elections again next week.
