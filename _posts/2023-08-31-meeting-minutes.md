# What We Went Over:

- Zelle: Digital Payment Option
    - We will be using Zelle for the digital payment option account for the ACM
    - QR codes will be printed out soon for the account
    - Chose Zelle since it can be connected directly to the ACM bank account and allows ease of transfer for accounts through the board
- SIG-Workshop Logistics
    - Discussed on times for the SIG-Workshop, whether for it to be flexable or strict time
        - With a flexable time, can be helpful for people to find a time to work for them
        - For a strict time, people in the room will be able to know what times the room will be reserved for a meeting
    - Board decided unanimously that the SIG-Workshop will be at variable times within the ACM room. This topic may be discussed further in the future if needed
    - Forms for this SIG are completed and ready for the Kickoff Meeting

    - New QR codes will be provided to follow the ACM through MyNDSU, as well as more announcements
- SIG-Compete

    - This SIG will focus on preparing members for programming competitions
- MICS
