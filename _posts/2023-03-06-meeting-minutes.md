        - students who are members of the National ACM
        - members of the local Chapter
        - and meet NDSU Congress of Student Organizationâ€™s requirements.

    - Voting will be done in person and in Discord voice chat
    - Link will be sent in Discord
    - Voting will be anonymous but number of people will be head counted against submissions in person and in vc
- Continue work on clean-up for next term
    - Membership Form clean-up
        - Some sheets have no back side or no front side (need to sort and staple)
        - Only about half the people checked the term of service
        - Next board item (and starting now) is being more diligent about filling the entire forms
    - Have accurate names on Debit Board
        - Use first name and first letter of last name
    - Make sure everyone on ballot is actually running
        - Mitchell confirmed it
    - Google-Drive Organization
    - Reflection: What was done well? What could be done better?
        - Weekly meetings should be more interactive (more activities than lectures)
        - Teaching languages at a weekly meeting has had mixed results
            - Make sure to have a git meeting
            - Decide topics over summer for fall
        - Reaching out more to companies and lots of new contacts
        - Make sure to know what evens faculty wants us to attend (even if not official)
        - SIG-Collab has been going well
            - Shorter projects
            - Smaller scopes
            - Adjustments instead of lots of fully new products
            - Both using Trello
        - Extended board was a good idea but under-utilized 
            - Maybe lump librarian into secretary 
        - Do better upkeep of records
        - Do better communication with department
        - Send lots of emails if they don't communicate
        - Don't be afraid to try new things and reverse them
        - Keep doing Class Room Visits
            - Professors have been doing a lot better with communicating
            - Try to have two people go to each
        - Plan for expos sooner
            - Bring drinks
            - Keep trying to think of a hands on booth activity
        - Make sure to limit the speakers during Kickoff
            - People want to network, don't spend entire time presenting
        - Use announcement bot for late risers
            - But don't send out too many in one week, try to group them
            - Posters are super cool and working well
            - Check how many posters we can put up
        - Interesting idea: use roles to ping for board meetings and game night
        - We will have defined role responsibilities on the drive
        - Board talks outside of official weekly board meeting should be put in the discord chat
        - The Chair is the one who communicates with faculty
        - Mics Competition is back up, next board should look into it
        - Once a Board decision is made, it is final
        - Having a board schedule for meetings has been good
        - Secretary should make sure online calendar is up to date
        - Secretary keep doing monthly emails
        - Above $1,000, we try to upgrade and spend money
            - Board should define how feedback will be done with the member body
            - Doesn't mean we can't under $1,000 but we try not to have a nest egg above it
